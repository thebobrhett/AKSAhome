An intranet homepage for showing news items with links to other applications

I created this page for use as an intranet homepage for our company.

Features:
Written in classic asp.
Page divided into sections.
Upper left div is company logo & slogan or motto.
Left side is menu to other applications.
Top is a content rotator for various content (safety & quality reminders from employees)
Top right is a weather bug from weather4you.
The rest of the page is populated with articles, announcements, cafeteria menus, etc of interest to employees. These items can be scheduled to appear and disappear at set times so that items can be posted only when and as long as they are relevant.
Articles are kept in mySQL database.
